# CodeWhisper AI Enhancement Tasks

## Current Issues
1. Remove popup/badge functionality
   - Remove createBadge() function and its calls
   - Remove showBadge() and hideBadge() functions
   - Update progress indication through different means (maybe cursor style)

## New Features Implementation
1. Change Trigger Key
   - Replace Enter key trigger with Shift+Enter
   - Update handleKeyDown() to check for both Shift and Enter keys
   - Remove the comment pattern check since we want to process regardless of comments

2. Context Gathering Enhancement
   - Modify extractContext() to:
     - Get the entire file content up to cursor position
     - Include problem description from the page if available
     - Analyze the code structure to understand the current implementation

3. Cursor Position Management
   - Enhance getCursorPosition() to work better with different editors
   - Add functionality to remember the last cursor position
   - Ensure typing continues from where it was left off

4. Smart Code Analysis
   - Add function to analyze existing code structure
   - Implement logic to understand incomplete code blocks
   - Create context builder for better AI prompts

5. Editor Integration Improvements
   - Enhance editor detection for various platforms
   - Improve text insertion for different editor types
   - Add better support for Monaco, Ace, and CodeMirror editors

6. AI Response Processing
   - Modify the prompt to include better context
   - Update the system message to focus on completing partial code
   - Add handling for multi-file context if needed

7. Performance Optimization
   - Optimize typing animation for better performance
   - Add debouncing for API calls
   - Implement better error handling without visual popups

## Technical Improvements
1. Code Refactoring
   - Split code into smaller, focused modules
   - Implement better error handling
   - Add TypeScript support for better type safety

2. Testing
   - Add unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement integration tests for editor interactions
   - Add end-to-end tests for full workflow

3. Documentation
   - Update README with new functionality
   - Add JSDoc comments for all functions
   - Create developer documentation for future maintenance

## Priority Order
1. Remove popup/badge functionality
2. Implement Shift+Enter trigger
3. Enhance context gathering
4. Improve cursor position management
5. Implement smart code analysis
6. Enhance editor integration
7. Update AI response processing
8. Optimize performance
9. Refactor code
10. Add tests and documentation
